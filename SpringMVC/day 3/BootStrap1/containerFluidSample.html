  <p class="jumbotron">So for example, say your browser window is 1000px wide.
<br/>  
  <br/>As it's greater than the min-width of 992px, your .container element will have a width of 970px.<br/> You then slowly widen your browser window.<br/> The width of your .container won't change until you get to 1200px, 
  <br/>at which it will jump to 1170px wide and stay that way for any larger browser widths.
<br/>Your .container-fluid element, on the other hand, will constantly resize as you make even the smallest changes to your browser width.
